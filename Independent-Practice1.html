    <body>
       <h1>1. p tag</h1>
       <p>Paragraph one is the best paragraph of all!</p>
        
        <p>Paragraph two is pretty sweet too though!</p>
        
        <p>
            No way! Paragraph three is definitely the best, no comparison.
        </p>
                <h4>N.B:</h4>
        I have also realized that it is possible to write text without p tags...they come in handy when you wanna start a new paragraph (you know...for spacing purposes).
        
        <h1>2. h tags</h1>
        <p>These are for adding headings in a web page, the headings can vary in size depending on what number you put after the 'h'. These tags run from h1 to h6, where the latter is the smallest heading.</p>
        
        <h6>The tiniest heading</h6>
        
        <h1>3. strong tag</h1>
        The 'strong' tag is to make things <strong>bold</strong>.  I also found out that the 'b' tag does the same thing also.
        
        <h1>4. em tag</h1>
        The 'em' tag is to make words <em>italic</em>. 
        You can also combine them: to bolden and italize the same <em><strong>word</strong></em>.
       
        
        <h1>5. marquee tag</h1>
        The marquee tag is used for scrolling piece of text or image displayed either horizontally across or vertically down your web site page depending on the settings.<marquee>text</marquee> My text is scrolling horizontally.This is super COOL! 
        
        <h1>6. mark tag</h1>
		The 'mark' tag is used to <mark>highlight</mark> text that is of special interest or relevance in an HTML document. It marks the text with a yellow colour(I wonder if the colour can be customized?!) 
        <h1>7. sub tag</h1>
        The 'sub' tag defines <sub>subscript</sub> text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H<sub>2</sub>O. 
        
        <h1>8. sup tag</h1>
        Use the 'sup' tag to define <sup>superscripted</sup> text, for eaxample: 2<sup>3</sup> = 8.
        
        <h3>
            That is it for now...
        </h3>
