        <h1>My First Website</h1>
        <p>This is so fun! But I need to figure out how to make things <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
        <p>For <em>italics</em>, use the 'em' tag.</p>
        
        <p>The <code>code</code> tag is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font. </p>
        <p>The <small>small</small> tag is used to make the text one size smaller. Note that it can not make the text smaller than the browser's minimum font size.</p>
        <p>The <del>del</del> tag represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information</p>
        <p>This tag for scrolling was discussed earlier:<marquee>marquee</marquee></p>
        <p>The <q>q</q></p> indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the 'blockquote' element.
