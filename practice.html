            Second paragraph...duh!! Can't I add emojiz in html? Guess that is in CSS as well...banange, I can't wait for us to get to CSS. Like imagine, a skeleton walking around with its body and head but without skin...FREAKY!!!!

            Lastly, the third paragraph. HTML....html...how many times did I call you? why are you soooooo boring? no wonder things are all plain and uninteresting. Can't someone add colour in html at all???!!! Anyway, if you gat it all figured out my dear HTML, then CSS would be useless. Thanx for giving CSS a chance to shine:)
